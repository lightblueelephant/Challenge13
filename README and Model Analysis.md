# Challenge13

Analysis: The most accurate model is "nn" rather than nn_A1 or nn_A2

**Package Requirements and Versions: pip install x versions -python --tensorflow --tensorflow.keras.layers --tensorflow.keras.models --sklearn.model_selection --sklearn.preprocessing



Purpose of Use: Neural Network models to use to predict if an applicant wil become a successful business.

Steps: (see GC_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb for more detailed steps)
1) Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.
2) Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.
3) Optimize the neural network model.
